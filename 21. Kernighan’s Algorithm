Write an efficient program to count the number of 1s or number of set bits in the binary representation of an integer.
Input : n = 6
Output : 2
Binary representation of 6 is 110 and has 2 set bits

Brute force - O(log n)
unsigned int countSetBits(unsigned int n)
{
    unsigned int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        count += n & 1;
        n = n/2;
    }
    return count;
}

Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm: O(log n)
unsigned int countSetBits(int n)
{
     unsigned int counter = 0;
     while (n != 0) {
        int rsbm = n & -n;     //rightmost set bit mask
        n = n - rsbm;
        counter++;
     }
     return counter;
}
