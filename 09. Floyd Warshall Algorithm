It is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. This algorithm is highly efficient and can handle graphs with both positive and negative edge weights.
It can detect -ve cycle. If in the matrix diagonal elements are less than zero => (grid[i][j] < 0) -> return "cycle is present"

Time Complexity: O(V3), where V is the number of vertices 
Auxiliary Space: O(V2), to create a 2-D matrix in order to store the shortest distance for each pair of nodes.

void shortest_distance(vector<vector<int>>& grid){
        int n = grid.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
                
                if(grid[i][j] == -1)
                    grid[i][j] = 100000;
